  TODO URGENT!!!
  
  We must flow the absolute context timestamp along with all observable
  updates so we can correctly schedule updates on the timeline. This was
  a major flaw in all the prior versions, and resulted in a lot of nasty
  boilerplate in the client code to ensure event timing was correct.
